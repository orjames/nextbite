# nextbite
## MongoExpressReactNode.js Project. Done using TypeScript

### Overview

Have you ever been in a situation where you and your friend/spouse/partner/whatever want to go out for dinner but can't think of what to get? Of course you have. Nextbite ends your indecisiveness and hunger by providing you with a 'feed' of photos of food. These photos can only be posted by local companies, and usually offer deals. User's scroll until they find something that catches their eye. Think instagram for food.

### Technical Goals

Goals for my app include (but definitely are not limited to):

* **Use Express** to build an application backend 
* **Create an application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** distributed as appropriate amongst those models.
* Create own front-end
* **Add authentication/authorization** to restrict access to appropriate users
* Layout and style front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
* **Deploy application online** so it's publicly accessible.
